# Edge/Fog installation

In an IoT system, edges and fog gateways are two different types of components that can be used to collect, process, and transmit data. Edges refer to devices that are located at the very edge of the network, closest to the sensors and devices that are generating data. These devices are typically low-power and may be used to perform basic processing and analysis of data, as well as to transmit data to the cloud or other central locations.

Fog gateways, on the other hand, are devices that are located further up the network hierarchy, closer to the cloud or other central systems. These devices are typically more powerful than edges and are capable of performing more complex processing and analysis tasks.

In many cases, edges and fog gateways can be combined to better meet the business and technical needs of an IoT system. For example, edges might be used to collect data from sensors and transmit it to fog gateways, which can then perform more advanced processing and analysis tasks before transmitting the data to the cloud or other central systems. By using both edges and fog gateways, businesses can take advantage of the strengths of each component to create a more efficient and effective IoT system.

The appropriate Sensoworks Edge/Fog gateway solution for your project will depend on various factors, including the specific scenario of the project, the types of devices that need to be connected, the type of analysis required, and any additional considerations.

The component(s) can be installed either locally or on the cloud (depends on needs and available resources):
